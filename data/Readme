The data can be downloaded from (https://www.dropbox.com/s/48oe7shjq0ih151/data.tar.gz?dl=0).
Each dataset is a dictionary containing the following keys:
- `train_idx`, `val_idx` and `test_idx` are indices for training, validation and testing; 
`label` corresponds to the labels of the nodes;
- the layer names of the dataset: e.g., `MAM` and `MDM` for the `imdb` dataset.
